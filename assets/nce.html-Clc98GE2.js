This morning, however, a firemen accidentally discovered the cause. He noticed the remains of a snake which was wound round the electric wires of a 16,000-volt power line.

The machine was used in a cave near the seashore where -- it is said -- pirates used to hide gold. The pirates would often bury gold in the cave and then fail to collect it. Armed with the new machine, a search party went into the cave hoping to find buried treasure. The leader of the party was examining the soil near the entrance to the cave when the machine showed that there was gold under the ground. Very excited, the party dug a hole two feet deep. They finally found a small gold coin which was almost worthless. The party then searched the whole cave thoroughly but did not find anything except an empty tin trunk.

However, when I was going out shopping last week, I noticed him in the garden near the gate. This time he was barking so that someone would let him out! Since then, he has developed another bad habit. As soon as he opens the gate from the outside, he comes into the garden and waits until the gate shuts. Then he sits and barks until someone lets him out. After this he immediately lets himself in and begins barking again.

He said that it would be possible to build a platform in the centre of the Channel. This platform would serve as a port and a railway station. The tunnel would be well-ventilated if tall chimneys were built above sea level. In 1860, a better plan was put forward by an Englishman, William Low. He suggested that a double railway-tunnel should be built. This would solve the problem of ventilation, for if a train entered this tunnel, it would draw in fresh air behind it. Forty-two years later a tunnel was actually begun. If, at the time, the British had not feared invasion, it would have been completed. The world had to wait almost another 100 years for the Channel Tunnel. It was officially opened on March 7,1994, finally connecting Britain to the European continent.</span></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><h3 id="lesson-65-jumbo-versus-the-police" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lesson-65-jumbo-versus-the-police"><span>Lesson 65 Jumbo versus the police</span></a></h3><div class="language- line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="shiki" data-ext="" style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#abb2bf;--shiki-light-bg:#FAFAFA;--shiki-dark-bg:#282c34;"><pre class="shiki shiki-themes one-light one-dark-pro vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>Last Christmas, the circus owner, Jimmy Gates, decided to take some presents to a children&#39;s hospital.

<span class="line"><span>However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw &#39;a large cat&#39; only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes. Several people complained of &quot;cat-like noises&#39; at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.</span></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><h3 id="lesson-2-thirteen-equals-one" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lesson-2-thirteen-equals-one"><span>Lesson 2 Thirteen equals one</span></a></h3><div class="language- line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="shiki" data-ext="" style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#abb2bf;--shiki-light-bg:#FAFAFA;--shiki-dark-bg:#282c34;"><pre class="shiki shiki-themes one-light one-dark-pro vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>Our vicar is always raising money for one cause or another, but he has never managed to get enough money to have the church clock repaired.

This head must have been found in Classical times and carefully preserved. It was very old and precious even then. When the archaeologists reconstructed the fragments, they were amazed to find that the goddess turned out to be a very modern-looking woman. She stood three feet high and her hands rested on her hip. She was wearing a full-length skirt which swept the ground.

When the article arrived, the editor read the first sentence and then refused to publish it. The article began: &#39;Hundreds of steps lead to the high wall which surrounds the president&#39;s palace.&#39; The editor at once sent the journalist a fax instructing him to find out the exact number of steps and the height of the wall.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The journalist immediately set out to obtain these important facts, but he took a long time to send them. Meanwhile, the editor was getting impatient, for the magazine would soon go to press. He sent the journalist two urgent telegrams, but received no reply. He sent yet another telegram informing the journalist that if he did not reply soon he would be fired. When the journalist again failed to reply, the editor reluctantly published the article as it had originally been written. A week later, the editor at last received a telegram from the journalist. Not only had the poor man been arrested, but he had been sent to prison as well. However, he had at last been allowed to send a cable in which he informed the editor that he had been arrested while counting the 1084 steps leading to the 15-foot wall which surrounded the president&#39;s palace.</span></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><h3 id="lesson-6-smash-and-grab" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lesson-6-smash-and-grab"><span>Lesson 6 Smash-and-grab</span></a></h3><div class="language- line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="shiki" data-ext="" style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#abb2bf;--shiki-light-bg:#FAFAFA;--shiki-dark-bg:#282c34;"><pre class="shiki shiki-themes one-light one-dark-pro vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>The expensive shops in a famous arcade near Piccadilly were just opening. At this time of the morning, the arcade was almost empty. Mr Taylor, the owner of a jewellery shop was admiring a new window display. Two of his assistants had been working busily since 8 o&#39;clock and had only just finished. Diamond necklaces and rings had been beautifully arranged on a background of black velvet. After gazing at the display for several minutes, Mr Taylor went back into his shop.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The silence was suddenly broken when a large car, with its headlights on and its horn blaring, roared down the arcade. It came to a stop outside the jeweler&#39;s. One man stayed at the wheel while two others with black stockings over their faces jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron bars. While this was going on, Mr Taylor was upstairs. He and his staff began throwing furniture out of the window. Chairs and tables went flying into the arcade. One of the thieves was struck by a heavy statue, but he was too busy helping himself to diamonds to notice any pain. The raid was all over in three minutes, for the men scrambled back into the car and it moved off at a fantastic speed. Just as it was leaving, Mr Taylor rushed out and ran after it throwing ashtrays and vases, but it was impossible to stop the thieves.

At 2470 metres, it is the highest mountain pass in Europe. The famous monastery of St Bernard, which was founded in the eleventh century, lies about a mile away. For hundreds of years, St Bernard dogs have saved the lives of travellers crossing the dangerous Pass. These friendly dogs, which were first brought from Asia, were used as watch-dogs even in Roman times. Now that a tunnel has been built through the mountains, the Pass is less dangerous, but each year, the dogs are still sent out into the snow whenever a traveller is in difficulty. Despite the new tunnel, there are still a few people who rashly attempt to cross the Pass on foot.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>During the summer months, the monastery is very busy, for it is visited by thousands of people who cross the Pass in cars, As there are so many people about, the dogs have to be kept in a special enclosure. In winter, however, life at the monastery is quite different. The temperature drops to -30 and very few people attempt to cross the Pass. The monks Prefer winter to summer for they have more privacy. The dogs have greater freedom, too, for they are allowed to wander outside their enclosure. The only regular visitors to the monastery in winter are parties of skiers who go there at Christmas and Easter.

They can be friendly and affectionate towards humans, but they lead mysterious lives of their own as well. They never become submissive like dogs and horses. As a result, humans have learned to respect feline independence. Most cats remain suspicious of humans all their lives. One of the things that fascinates us most about cats is the popular belief that they have nine lives. Apparently, there is a good deal of truth in this idea. A cat&#39;s ability to survive falls is based on fact.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Recently the New York Animal Medical Centre made a study of 132cats over a period of five months. All these cats had one experience in common: they had fallen off high buildings, yet only eight of them died from shock or injuries. Of course, New Yorkis the ideal place for such an interesting study, because there is no shortage of tall buildings. There are plenty of high-rise windowsills to fall from! One cat, Sabrina, fell 32storeys, yet only suffered from a broken tooth. ‘Cats behave like well-trained paratroopers, ’ a doctor said. It seems that the further cats fall, the less they are likely to injure themselves. In a long drop, they reach speeds of 60 miles an hour and more. At high speeds, falling cats have time to relax. They stretch out their legs like flying squirrels. This increases their air-resistance and reduces the shock of impact when they hit the ground.</span></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><h3 id="lesson-10-the-loss-of-titanic" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lesson-10-the-loss-of-titanic"><span>Lesson 10 The loss of Titanic</span></a></h3><div class="language- line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="shiki" data-ext="" style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#abb2bf;--shiki-light-bg:#FAFAFA;--shiki-dark-bg:#282c34;"><pre class="shiki shiki-themes one-light one-dark-pro vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>The great ship, Titanic, sailed for New York from Southampton on April 10th, 1912. She was carrying 1316 passengers and a crew of 89l. Even by modern standards, the 46,000 ton Titanic was a colossal ship. At that time, however, she was not only the largest ship that had ever been built, but was regarded as unsinkable, for she had sixteen water- tight compartments. Even if two of these were flooded, she would still be able to float.

After the alarm had been given, the great ship turned sharply to avoid a direct collision. The Titanic turned just in time, narrowly missing the immense wall of ice which rose over 100 feet out of the water beside her. Suddenly, there was a slight trembling sound from below, and the captain went down to see what had happened. The noise had been so faint that no one thought that the ship had been damaged. Below, the captain realized to his horror that the Titanic was sinking rapidly, for five of her sixteen water-tight compartments had already been flooded ! The order to abandon ship was given and hundreds of people plunged into the icy water. As there were not enough life-boats for everybody, 1500 lives were lost.</span></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><h3 id="lesson-11-not-guilty" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lesson-11-not-guilty"><span>Lesson 11 Not guilty</span></a></h3><div class="language- line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="shiki" data-ext="" style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#abb2bf;--shiki-light-bg:#FAFAFA;--shiki-dark-bg:#282c34;"><pre class="shiki shiki-themes one-light one-dark-pro vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>Customs officers are quite tolerant these days, but they can still stop you when you are going through the Green Channel and have nothijng to declare.

In times of peace, when business was bad, Hawkwood and his men would march into a city-state and, after burning down a few farms, would offer to go away if protection money was paid to them. Hawkwood made large sums of money in this way. In spite of this, the Italians regarded him as a sort of hero.

<span class="line"><span>The Verrazano Bridge, which was designed by Othmar Ammann, joins Brooklyn to Staten Island. It has a span of 4260 feet. The bridge is so long that the shape of the earth had to be taken into account by its designer. Two great towers support four huge cables. The towers are built on immense underwater platforms made of steel and concrete. The platforms extend to a depth of over 100 feet under the sea. These alone took sixteen months to build. Above the surface of the water, the towers rise to a height of nearly 700 feet. They support the cables from which the bridge has been suspended. Each of the four cables contains 26,108 lengths of wire. It has been estimated that if the bridge were packed with cars, it would still only be carrying a third of its total capacity. However, size and strength are not the only important things about this bridge. Despite its immensity, it is both simple and elegant, fulfilling its designer&#39;s dream to create &#39;an enormous object drawn as faintly as possible&#39;.</span></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><h3 id="lesson-18-electric-currents-in-modern-art" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lesson-18-electric-currents-in-modern-art"><span>Lesson 18 Electric currents in modern art</span></a></h3><div class="language- line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="shiki" data-ext="" style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#abb2bf;--shiki-light-bg:#FAFAFA;--shiki-dark-bg:#282c34;"><pre class="shiki shiki-themes one-light one-dark-pro vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>Modern sculpture rarely surprises us any more. The idea that modern art can only be seen in museums is mistaken. Even people who take no interest in art cannot have failed to notice examples of modern sculpture on display in public places. Strange forms stand in gardens, and outside buildings and shops. We have got quite used to them. Some so-called &#39;modern&#39; pieces have been on display for nearly fifty years.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>In spite of this, some people--including myself--were surprised by a recent exhibition of modern sculpture. The first thing I saw when I entered the art gallery was a notice which said: &#39;Do not touch the exhibits. Some of them are dangerous!&#39; The objects on display were pieces of moving sculpture. Oddly shaped forms that are suspended from the ceiling and move in response to a gust of wind are quite familiar to everybody. These objects, however, were different. Lined up against the wall, there were long thin wires attached to metal spheres. The spheres had been magnetized and attracted or repelled each other all the time. In the centre of the hall, there were a number of tall structures which contained coloured lights. These lights flickered continuously like traffic lights which have gone mad. Sparks were emitted from small black boxes and red lamps flashed on and off angrily. It was rather like an exhibition of prehistoric electronic equipment. These Peculiar forms not only seemed designed to shock people emotionally, but to give them electric shocks as well !</span></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><h3 id="lesson-19-a-very-dear-cat" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lesson-19-a-very-dear-cat"><span>Lesson 19 A very dear cat</span></a></h3><div class="language- line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="shiki" data-ext="" style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#abb2bf;--shiki-light-bg:#FAFAFA;--shiki-dark-bg:#282c34;"><pre class="shiki shiki-themes one-light one-dark-pro vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>Kidnappers are rarely interested in Animals, but they recently took considerable interest in Mrs Eleanor Ramsay&#39;s cat. Mrs Eleanor Ramsay, a very wealthy old lady, has shared a flat with her cat, Rastus, for a great many years. Rastus leads an orderly life. He usually takes a short walk in the evenings and is always home by seven o&#39;clock. One evening, however, he failed to arrive. Mrs Ramsay got very worried. She looked everywhere for him but could not find him.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Three day after Rastus&#39; disappearance, Mrs Ramsay received an anonymous letter. The writer stated that Rastus was in safe hands and would be returned immediately if Mrs Ramsay paid a ransom of &amp;1000. Mrs Ramsay was instructed to place the money in a cardboard box and to leave it outside her door. At first, she decided to go to the police, but fearing that she would never see Rastus again --the letter had made that quite clear--she changed her mind. She drew &amp;1000 from her bank and followed the kidnapper&#39;s instructions. The next morning, the box had disappeared but Mrs Ramsay was sure that the kidnapper would keep his word. Sure enough, Rastus arrived punctually at seven o&#39;clock that evening. He looked very well, though he was rather thirsty, for he drank half a bottle of milk. The police were astounded when Mrs Ramsay told them what she had</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>

Considering the amount she paid, he was dear in more ways than one!</span></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><h3 id="lesson-20-pioneer-pilots" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lesson-20-pioneer-pilots"><span>Lesson 20 Pioneer pilots</span></a></h3><div class="language- line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="shiki" data-ext="" style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#abb2bf;--shiki-light-bg:#FAFAFA;--shiki-dark-bg:#282c34;"><pre class="shiki shiki-themes one-light one-dark-pro vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>In 1908 Lord Northcliffe offered a prize of &amp;1000 to the first man who would fly across the English Channel. Over a year passed before the first attempt was made. On July 19th, 1909, in the early morning, Hubert Latham took off from the French coast in his plane the &#39;Antoinette IV&#39;. He</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>

<span class="line"><span>Two days later, Louis Bleriot arrived near Calais with a plane called &#39;No. XI&#39;. Bleriot had been making planes since 1905 and this was his latest model. A week before, he had completed a successful overland flight during which he covered twenty-six miles. Latham, however did not give up easily. He, too, arrived near Calais on the same day with a new &#39;Antonette&#39;. It looks as if there would be an exciting race across the Channel. Both planes were going to take off on July 25th, but Latham failed to get up early enough. After making a short test flight at 4.15 a.m., Bleriot set off half an hour later. His great flight lasted thirty seven minutes. When he landed near Dover, the first person to greet him was a local policeman. Latham made another attempt a week later and got within half a mile of Dover, but he was unlucky again. His engine failed and he landed on the sea for the second time.</span></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div>`,361)]))}const o=n(l,[["render",t]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/subject/nce.html","title":"新概念英语","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"title":"新概念英语","category":"学科","tag":["英语"],"article":false,"feed":false,"seo":false,"head":[]},"git":{"createdTime":1750315875000,"updatedTime":1750315875000,"contributors":[{"name":"JQiue","username":"JQiue","email":"861947542@qq.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/JQiue"}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":79.38,"words":23813},"filePathRelative":"subject/nce.md"}');export{o as comp,h as data};
