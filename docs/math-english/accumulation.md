## 动词短语

动词短语通常是指动词后面跟着一个介词或副词短语的动词，英语中存在用动词短语代替与其同义的单个动词的强烈趋势，比如听到敲门声，会说 Come in，而不是 Enter。这些动词常与表示位置或方向的词组合，比如 along，down，in，off，on，out，over，under 等

```
The cats are running along the wall.
The children are jumping off the branch.
He is going into a shop.
```

large 仅指物理上的大，是 small 的反义词，通常指体积、面积、形状、数量方面的大，修饰人时指个子大

big 所表示的大不仅指体积大，还很重，在修饰人时，通常指大人物，但个子未必高大

```plain
It is a big house.
She's very big in the filmdom.
```

### small 与 little

small 指物理上的小或少，是 large 的反义词

```plain

```

little 也表示小和少，但有小而可爱的感情色，是 big 的反义词

She has the sweetest little smile.
```

some 和 any 是最常用的数量词，some 用于肯定句，或期望是肯定回答的疑问句
